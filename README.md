## My process

### What I learned

1. JavaScript Basics: This project involves fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, loops, conditional statements, and event handling.

2. DOM Manipulation: The code interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the HTML content based on game events and user interactions.

3. Algorithmic Thinking: The project requires implementing game logic, including card value calculation, handling Aces, determining winners, and managing game flow.

### Continued development

For future development, consider expanding the game into a two-person experience played in real-time by implementing a multiplayer feature. This would allow players to engage in blackjack matches against each other, adding a competitive edge and social interaction to the game. By integrating real-time communication functionalities, such as chat or voice capabilities, players can interact with each other during gameplay, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
