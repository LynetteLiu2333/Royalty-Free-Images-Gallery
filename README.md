## Overview

This project is a web-based image gallery that dynamically fetches and displays images from the Unsplash API. Users can either view a random selection of photos or search for specific images based on a query parameter, with the ability to view images in a pop-up, navigate through them, and download high-resolution versions.

## My process

### What I Learned

- **Unsplash API Integration:** Practical experience integrating the Unsplash API for fetching and displaying images. Handling API requests and responses, including dealing with query parameters to filter image searches based on user input.

- **Modular Code Organization:** Improved code structure by breaking down functionalities into modular functions. Enhanced maintainability and readability, making it easier to debug and extend the codebase in the future.

- **State Management:** Managed the state of the application to keep track of the current set of displayed images, user search queries, and navigation through image pop-ups. Used JavaScript objects and arrays to store and update the application state.

- **Interactive Features:** Developed interactive features such as image pop-ups for viewing images in detail. Implemented navigation controls within the pop-ups to allow users to browse through images without closing the pop-up.

- **CSS for Styling:** Applied CSS techniques to style the gallery, pop-ups, and navigation controls. Used flexbox and grid layouts for responsive design, ensuring the gallery looks good on different screen sizes.

- **Error Handling:** Implemented error handling to manage API request failures and invalid user inputs. Displayed user-friendly error messages and fallback content to ensure a seamless experience.
